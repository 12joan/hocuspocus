# Persistence

To persist the documents you must instruct the server to:

1. Store in the database the document using the `onChange` hook, or better yet the `onStoreDocument` hook (which is the same as the first one but with debounce already configured).
2. Load from the database the document using the hook `onLoadDocument`.

Actually, you don't even have to use those 2 hooks! We have already created on top of them a simple abstraction in the form of a [database extension](https://tiptap.dev/hocuspocus/server/database-extensions) (example of use in the link).

However, in case you are a curious mind, here is an example of what it would be like to do it with hooks (It can be a good way to familiarize yourself with the concepts).

TO-DO: replace `onChange` with `onStoreDocument`

```ts
import { debounce } from "debounce";
import { Server } from "@hocuspocus/server";
import { Doc } from "yjs";

let debounced;

const server = Server.configure({
  async onChange(data) {
    const save = () => {
      // Save to database. Example:
      // saveToDatabase(data.document, data.documentName);

      // Maybe you want to store the user who changed the document?
      // Guess what, you have access to your custom context from the
      // onAuthenticate hook here. See auth section for more details
      console.log(`Document ${data.documentName} changed by ${data.context.user.name}`);
    };
    debounced?.clear();
    debounced = debounce(() => save, 4000);
    debounced();
  },

  async onLoadDocument(data): Doc {
    return loadFromDatabase(data.documentName) || createInitialDocTemplate();
  },
});

server.listen();

function createInitialDocTemplate() {
  return new Doc();
  // do anything you want here
}
```
